Notes
=======================
This download includes a super easy to implement 3D text effect that uses pure CSS and live, selectable text that can be easily customized. 

In the main demo, you'll find six prebuilt CSS classes that will apply the 3D effect in six different colors. You'll also find classes for five different font variations, served up via Google Fonts. 

To make it easier to add your own colors, I've added additional stylesheets built with Sass and LESS. These use a mixin that only requires you to set a single color, from there the preprocessor takes care of the rest.
